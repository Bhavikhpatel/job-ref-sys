Your Optimization Objectives

Strategic Remark Implementation (CRITICAL PRIORITY):

Treat the content within the <remark> tags as a high-priority directive. These remarks often contain specific strategic pivots or corrections for previous ATS failures.

If the remark identifies a specific gap (e.g., "Not enough focus on Leadership"), you must aggressively engineer the "Professional Experience" bullets to highlight this trait, even if it requires rephrasing technical tasks as leadership achievements.

If the remark requests emphasis on a specific skill or domain (e.g., "Highlight FinTech experience"), prioritize keywords related to this domain above others, ensuring they appear in the Summary, Skills, and multiple Experience bullets.

Use the remark to resolve ambiguities: if the JD is broad but the remark says "Target the Senior Engineer role," filter keywords that align specifically with seniority (e.g., "Architected," "Mentored") rather than junior tasks.

Keyword Integration for 90+ ATS:

Extract all relevant keywords, technical skills, certifications, role responsibilities, and industry-specific terminology from the job description.

Prioritize exact phrase matches to the job description (e.g., same wording as "Responsibilities", "Requirements", and "Qualifications" sections).

Ensure that every "must-have" or "required" skill, tool, or responsibility from the job description appears in at least two places in the resume (for example, in the Professional Summary or Technical Skills section and also in at least one bullet under Professional Experience or Key Projects).

For high-priority JD keywords, aim for three or more placements across different sections (e.g., Professional Summary, Technical Skills, and one or more bullets) to maximize keyword signal strength and ATS matching confidence.

Weave these keywords naturally into the resume content to improve keyword matching without compromising readability or authenticity.

Where appropriate, include both the expanded term and abbreviation (e.g., "Machine Learning (ML)", "Natural Language Processing (NLP)", "Large Language Model (LLM)").

Use synonym pairs and related terminology: if the JD mentions "model training," also include "model fine-tuning," "model optimization," "LLM fine-tuning," or "transfer learning" as appropriate.

Hard Skills Enhancement:

Identify and emphasize technical competencies (programming languages, frameworks, tools, methodologies, libraries, platforms, cloud services, databases) that match the job requirements.

Ensure these skills are prominently featured in both the Technical Skills section and within experience/project descriptions.

For any "preferred" or "nice-to-have" skills in the job description that the candidate actually has, integrate them as well to boost ATS matching.

Use exact tool/framework names as they appear in the JD (e.g., if JD says "PyTorch," use "PyTorch" not "pytorch" or "Pytorch").

Include version numbers or qualifiers when relevant (e.g., "Python 3.9+", "TensorFlow 2.x") if they appear in the JD.

List tools in pairs or clusters that naturally relate to JD workflows (e.g., "Git and GitHub for version control," "REST APIs and microservices architecture").

Soft Skills Integration:

Incorporate relevant soft skills (leadership, communication, problem-solving, collaboration, stakeholder management, ownership, project management, analytical thinking, agility, cross-functional teamwork) naturally within achievement statements and experience descriptions.

Align soft skills language with wording used in the job description where truthful and appropriate.

Use action verbs that imply soft skill mastery: "led," "mentored," "collaborated," "communicated," "owned," "managed," "orchestrated," "spearheaded."

ATS-Friendly Formatting:

Ensure content is structured for optimal ATS parsing:

Use clear, scannable bullet points.

Avoid special characters, tables, graphics, or complex formatting.

Use standard section headers that ATS tools recognize (e.g., "Professional Experience", "Key Projects", "Technical Skills").

Include metrics and quantifiable results where possible.

Maintain consistent formatting and tense throughout.

Use consistent spacing and indentation so ATS parsers do not misinterpret structure.

Advanced ATS Optimization Techniques
Keyword Density and Distribution:

Identify the top 5–10 most critical keywords from the job description (typically: role title, primary technical skills, key methodologies, domain expertise).

Ensure these top keywords appear in the Professional Summary, at least once in each Technical Skills category, and in at least two Professional Experience or Key Projects bullets.

Avoid keyword clustering (repetition of the same keyword too many times in one bullet or section), as this can trigger spam filters in ATS systems; instead, distribute keywords across bullets and sections.

Semantic Keyword Matching:

Many modern ATS systems use semantic/contextual matching in addition to exact keyword matching.

Group related terms together in bullets to reinforce semantic meaning. For example, if the JD discusses "model deployment," pair it with supporting concepts like "cloud infrastructure," "containerization," "CI/CD pipelines," or "monitoring," so the ATS understands the full context of your experience.

Title and Heading Optimization:

Ensure the job title (extracted or inferred) directly matches or closely mirrors the target job title from the JD.

If the JD uses specific role nomenclature (e.g., "Machine Learning Engineer" vs. "ML Engineer" vs. "AI/ML Engineer"), prioritize the exact phrasing used in the job description.

Metrics and Quantifiable Results Strategy:

Every bullet should contain at least one quantifiable metric (percentage, time duration, scale, volume) or a specific, measurable outcome.

Examples: "improved accuracy by 30%," "reduced latency from 2s to 500ms," "trained on 10M+ data points," "deployed to 5 cloud regions," "scaled to serve 100K+ concurrent users."

ATS systems often highlight and weight bullets with metrics higher than those without.

If quantifiable data is not available, use relative qualitative terms that imply scale: "significant improvement," "substantial reduction," "large-scale," "enterprise-grade," "production-level."

Relevant Experience Signal Boosting:

Within each bullet, explicitly call out how your contribution maps to the target job.

Use phrasing like "implemented [technology] for [use case relevant to JD]" or "architected [system] to address [problem domain mentioned in JD]."

This helps ATS systems infer relevance beyond simple keyword matching.

Acronym and Full Form Pairs:

When first introducing a technology or methodology, use both the full name and acronym if the acronym appears in the JD (e.g., "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)", "Large Language Model (LLM)", "Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)").

This increases the chance of keyword matches for both expansions and abbreviations.

Tense and Action Verb Consistency:

Use consistent tense (past tense for past roles, present tense if still ongoing).

Prioritize power action verbs that are commonly searched by recruiters: "architected," "engineered," "implemented," "optimized," "led," "deployed," "scaled," "transformed," "automated," "integrated."

Vary verbs across bullets to avoid repetition while maintaining professional tone.

Technical Depth Indicators:

ATS systems recognize certain phrases as indicators of deep technical involvement. Use where truthful:

"Architected end-to-end [system]" signals ownership and design thinking.

"Engineered [technology] from scratch" signals innovation and technical depth.

"Optimized [metric] through [specific technique]" signals problem-solving and technical expertise.

"Integrated [tool A] with [tool B]" signals systems thinking and tool proficiency.

Content Optimization by Section
Job Title

Extract directly from job description or infer from target role.

Use standard industry terminology.

Keep concise (2–4 words).

Ensure it matches the JD's role title phrasing as closely as possible (e.g., if JD says "ML Engineer," do not use "AI/ML Developer").

Professional Summary

2–3 sentences, 45 words maximum.

Highlight key relevant skills and experience level.

Include 2–3 top keywords and core responsibilities from the job description.

Focus on the value proposition to the employer and alignment with the target role.

Use industry terminology naturally and mirror key phrases from the job description where appropriate.

Structure as: [Years/Level] + [Core Expertise] + [Key Technologies] + [Desired Outcome/Value].

Example pattern: "5+ years of experience in machine learning and LLM development. Specialized in building end-to-end AI systems using Python, TensorFlow, and cloud platforms. Proven track record of delivering scalable models that improve business metrics."

Ensure the summary acts as a "keyword anchor" — frontload the most critical JD keywords here so ATS systems immediately recognize fit.

Professional Experience Bullets
Each bullet point should:

Start with a strong action verb.

Include specific technologies, tools, platforms, or methodologies used.

Quantify impact where possible (percentages, numbers, timeframes, scale).

Include relevant keywords naturally, especially those from the "Responsibilities" and "Requirements" sections of the job description.

Clearly demonstrate relevance to the target role and map to specific job description points wherever possible.

Prioritize clarity, concision, and measurable outcomes.

Do not repeat the job title, company name, location, or date range inside any bullet. Assume these appear as headings in the resume template.

Structure each bullet as: [Action Verb] + [Specific Technology/Methodology] + [Business/Technical Outcome] + [Quantified Impact].

Example: "Implemented RAG pipelines with vector embeddings and Gemini LLM, reducing search latency by 40% and improving answer accuracy by 35%."

Key Projects Section
Each project bullet should:

Specify concrete technologies, frameworks, and tools used.

Include metrics, scale, or specific outcomes wherever possible.

Highlight problem-solving approach, ownership, or end-to-end contribution.

Closely match the length and density of the original resume content.

Explicitly cover job-description-relevant responsibilities (e.g., model development, deployment, data pipelines, stakeholder collaboration) using JD language where suitable.

Do not repeat the project title inside any bullet. Assume project titles are handled separately in the resume template.

Structure similarly to experience bullets: [Action Verb] + [Core Technology Stack] + [Problem Solved or Innovation] + [Measurable Result].

Technical Skills Section

Organize by category/domain (e.g., "Programming Languages", "Machine Learning & LLM Frameworks", "Data Processing & ETL Tools", "Cloud & Infrastructure", "APIs & Integration Platforms", "Methodologies & Practices", "Version Control & DevOps").

Include 7 skill categories.

For each category, list 3–6 specific technologies/tools separated by commas.

Prioritize and foreground skills and tools mentioned in the job description (place JD-mentioned skills first within each category).

Ensure comprehensive, yet accurate, coverage of the candidate's expertise.

Reuse exact tool names and stack elements as written in the job description when they genuinely apply.

Use category headers that mirror terminology from the JD (e.g., if JD says "Data Engineering Tools," use that exact phrase rather than "Data Tools").

Include both broad categories (e.g., "Python") and specific libraries/frameworks (e.g., "NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch") to maximize keyword matching across different query patterns.

Output Format Requirements
You must output a Python dictionary with the following structure. Each key corresponds to a placeholder in the resume template. Ensure all values are strings:

{
"job_title": "string",
"professional_summary": "string",
"professional_experience_smartcard_ai_bullet_1": "string",
"professional_experience_smartcard_ai_bullet_2": "string",

Content Guidelines by Section
Job Title

See "Job Title" guidelines above.

Professional Summary

See "Professional Summary" guidelines above.

Professional Experience Bullets

Apply all rules under "Professional Experience Bullets".

Ensure bullets explicitly reflect responsibilities, tools, and outcomes that match the target job description.

Where the job description lists a responsibility as a bullet point, ensure that at least one resume bullet echoes that responsibility using similar phrasing and the same critical keywords, when truthful.

Do not add headings, role titles, company names, locations, or date ranges inside any bullet string.

Key Projects Section

Apply all rules under "Key Projects Section".

Ensure that across all Key Projects bullets, you cover additional job description requirements that may not fully fit under Professional Experience, so that together they maximize ATS keyword coverage.

Do not add project titles or headings inside any bullet string.

Word Count Targets for Experience and Projects
For the bullet content only (not including headings, role titles, company names, locations, date ranges, or project titles), aim for the following approximate total word counts:

SmartCard AI experience (sum of all three professional_experience_smartcard_ai_bullet_* values):

Target: around 62 words in total.

Eduskills Foundation experience (sum of all three professional_experience_eduskills_foundation_bullet_* values):

Target: around 55 words in total.

Legal System project (sum of all three key_projets_legal_system_bullet_* values):

Target: around 46 words in total.

Trigger Word project (sum of all three key_projets_trigger_word_bullet_* values):

Target: around 51 words in total.

"Around" means small deviations of a few words are acceptable, but keep each section close to its target to maintain layout and balance.

When adjusting length, preserve job-description-aligned skills, tools, and responsibilities first, and shorten less-relevant wording while keeping grammar and readability intact.

Keywords to Prioritize
Extract and prioritize keywords from the job description including:

Technical skills and tools (prioritize exact names and versions as written in JD).

Programming languages and frameworks.

Methodologies, approaches, and domains (e.g., "end-to-end model development", "A/B testing", "MLOps", "data pipelines", "model deployment", "prompt engineering").

Relevant certifications or qualifications.

Industry-specific terminology and role responsibilities.

Domain expertise areas.

Soft skills and competencies that appear in the JD.

Important Constraints

Length Consistency:

Maintain similar overall content length to the original resume to prevent overflow in the document template.

Keep each specified experience/project section close to its target word count as defined above.

Authenticity:

All content must be truthful and accurately represent actual skills, experience, and projects.

Do not fabricate technologies, certifications, or achievements.

Readability:

Weave keywords naturally—avoid obvious keyword stuffing or unnatural phrasing.

Use clear, concise language and correct grammar.

Each bullet should be immediately understandable to a human recruiter, not just optimized for ATS parsing.

ATS Compatibility:

Use standard terminology that ATS systems will recognize.

Avoid special characters or formatting that could break ATS parsing.

Favor exact matches to job description wording for important skills and responsibilities to maximize ATS keyword match.

Do not use Unicode characters, fancy dashes, or non-ASCII symbols; stick to standard ASCII.

Ensure consistent spacing, line breaks, and punctuation.

Relevance and Coverage:

Prioritize content that aligns directly with the target job description.

Aim to map each significant requirement or responsibility from the job description to at least one bullet in Professional Experience or Key Projects, and also reflect related skills in the Technical Skills section.

Reuse high-priority skills and keywords across multiple sections (summary, experience, projects, skills) when appropriate, to increase keyword frequency and keyword signal strength without harming readability.

For critical JD keywords, target at least 2–3 placements across the resume (e.g., in summary, skills section, and in one or more bullets).

Output Instructions

Analyze the current resume and job description carefully.

Extract all relevant keywords, responsibilities, and requirements systematically.

Review the Remark field specifically. If the remark conflicts with general instructions, the remark takes precedence.

Identify the top 5–10 most critical keywords and plan their distribution across resume sections.

Optimize each section according to the guidelines and advanced techniques above.

Ensure the output dictionary maintains the specified format exactly.

Output ONLY the dictionary as valid Python code—no explanations or additional text.

Make sure all string values are properly escaped for Python dictionary syntax.

Final Validation
Before outputting, ensure:

All 28 dictionary keys are present.

All values are non-empty strings.

The specific instructions found in the <remark> tag have been implemented in the output.

High-priority keywords from the job description (identified in extraction phase) are distributed across multiple sections and appear at least 2–3 times in the resume.
