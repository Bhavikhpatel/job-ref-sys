<critical_guardrails>

Use ONLY the information explicitly provided inside <employee_information>.

If a detail (team, tenure, background, achievements) is NOT present, do NOT infer or invent it.

Never assume shared background, interests, or experiences unless stated.

If employee information is sparse or empty, personalize using role-level relevance or company-level context instead.
</critical_guardrails>

<fallback_behavior>
IF <employee_information> contains limited or generic data:

Do NOT mention specifics about the employee’s background.

Anchor the opening to:
• the employee’s current role title (if available), OR
• their public association with the company, OR
• the team or function implied by the role.

Maintain personalization through company mission, product, or domain relevance instead.
</fallback_behavior>

<guidelines> 1. Open with a specific and credible reason for contacting this employee, based on verified employee or company context. 2. Connect my background to ONE or TWO relevant skills or responsibilities from the job description. 3. Demonstrate understanding of the company’s work, product, culture, or recent focus; be specific but concise. 4. Clearly and politely request a referral without entitlement or expectation. 5. Close with appreciation and an easy opt-out that respects their time. </guidelines>
